Multiple advantages for this particular use case.\n\t * In short, we need identical functionality to setState(), unless there is a prop defined\n\t * for the state key.  Also:\n\t *\n\t * 1. Single Renders\n\t *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\n\t *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\n\t *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\n\t *\n\t * 2. Simple Testing\n\t *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\n\t *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\n\t *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\n\t *\n\t * 3. Statics\n\t *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\n\t *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\n\t *    components.\n\t *\n\t * 4. Instance Methods\n\t *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\n\t *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\n\t */\n\tvar getAutoControlledStateValue = exports.getAutoControlledStateValue = function getAutoControlledStateValue(propName, props, state) {\n\t  var includeDefaults = arguments.length > 3 && arguments[3] !== undefined ? arguments[3] : false;\n\t\n\t  // regular props\n\t  var propValue = props[propName];\n\t  if (propValue !== undefined) return propValue;\n\t\n\t  if (includeDefaults) {\n\t    // defaultProps\n\t    var defaultProp = props[getDefaultPropName(propName)];\n\t    if (defaultProp !== undefined) return defaultProp;\n\t\n\t    // initial state - state may be null or undefined\n\t    if (state) {\n\t      var initialState = state[propName];\n\t      if (initialState !== undefined) return initialState;\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components,\n\t  // default checked/value if they were not present.\n\t  if (propName === 'checked') return false;\n\t  if (propName === 'value') return props.multiple ?

Multiple advantages for this particular use case.\n * In short, we need identical functionality to setState(), unless there is a prop defined\n * for the state key.  Also:\n *\n * 1. Single Renders\n *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\n *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\n *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\n *\n * 2. Simple Testing\n *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\n *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\n *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\n *\n * 3. Statics\n *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\n *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\n *    components.\n *\n * 4. Instance Methods\n *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\n *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\n */\nvar getAutoControlledStateValue = exports.getAutoControlledStateValue = function getAutoControlledStateValue(propName, props, state) {\n  var includeDefaults = arguments.length > 3 && arguments[3] !== undefined ? arguments[3] : false;\n\n  // regular props\n  var propValue = props[propName];\n  if (propValue !== undefined) return propValue;\n\n  if (includeDefaults) {\n    // defaultProps\n    var defaultProp = props[getDefaultPropName(propName)];\n    if (defaultProp !== undefined) return defaultProp;\n\n    // initial state - state may be null or undefined\n    if (state) {\n      var initialState = state[propName];\n      if (initialState !== undefined) return initialState;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components,\n  // default checked/value if they were not present.\n  if (propName === 'checked') return false;\n  if (propName === 'value') return props.multiple ?
